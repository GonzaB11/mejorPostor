## About the Project
This project is an application for managing reservations of a rehearsal room. Users submit offers with schedules and amounts, and the system selects the offers that maximize revenue without overlapping time slots, using a greedy heuristic algorithm.

## Features
- **Optimized Scheduling**: Uses a greedy algorithm to maximize earnings while avoiding schedule conflicts.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing using Windows Builder (JFrame).
- **Data Persistence**: Utilizes serialization to save and retrieve booking information.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures smooth user interaction and efficient performance.
- **Separated Presentation Design**: Implements a structured approach by separating business logic from the UI.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses JUnit for testing to ensure system reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for business logic.
- **Windows Builder (JFrame)**: UI design for an intuitive user experience.
- **Serialization**: Data persistence to store booking records.
- **JUnit**: Framework for writing and running automated tests.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GonzaB11/mejorPostor.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure you have **Windows Builder** installed for UI modifications.
4. Run the application from the main class.

## Future Improvements
- Adding a database for improved data management.
- Implementing user authentication.
- Enhancing the UI with modern design components.
